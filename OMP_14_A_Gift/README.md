Key Characteristics of Prime Numbers\
Divisors: A prime number can only be divided evenly by 1 and the number itself. \
Greater Than One: Prime numbers must be greater than 1. \

The Number 1: The number 1 is not considered a prime number because it has only one factor (itself)

A simple but slow method of checking the primality of a given number ⁠n⁠, called trial division, tests whether ⁠n⁠ is a multiple of any integer between 2 and ⁠sqrt(n)
